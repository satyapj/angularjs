        //This one is actually a vanilla JavaScript codebase with couple of commented code to highlight how DI(dependency injection works in AngularJS).

        //Creation & Deletion of objects (instance of services, controllers, $scope etc..) is internally managed via something called providers.
        //Think of providers as something like this.
        var providers = {

            role: 'Dev'
        };

        //And Imagine you need to write a constructor function that requires one of the items in providers to be injected to constructor at runtime at the time of instantiation. e.g.
        function MyCtrl(name, role){
            //something here..
        }

        //Since MyCtrl is instantiated at runtime and requested an item named 'name' to be supplied to it.
        //angularjs tries to locate that item in it's list of providers and supply to the constructor if available.

            fn.apply(null, [name, role]);
